                                <p dir="ltr">New students can book a trial lesson for 30 minutes at a cost of $20. If you then book a set of 5 lessons within 30 days of your trial lesson, you will get a refund of the trial lesson cost off the cost of your first set of 5 lessons. I offer regularly occurring lessons in General English for students looking to improve in all areas of learning and fluency. I also offer a variety of specially structured learning packages for those looking for targeted short-term commitments.

                                <p dir="ltr">For General English lessons on a regular basis, a block of 5 lessons is $140. All rates stated on this site are in US dollars.

                                <p dir="ltr">Each lesson is 55 minutes long and will only start on the hour, not on the half hour. Based on my assessment of the student(s)’s level and according to the student’s learning goals, we will use a variety of resources to target the specific areas you want to see improvement in. I will also give you an approximate length of time that I feel you will need to reach your goals. Every lesson is different and always incorporates all the skills necessary to improve fluency: grammar, vocabulary, listening, speaking, writing, reading and pronunciation. For details of the content of my structured packages, PLEASE CLICK <a href="./courses.html">HERE</a>. All lessons are conducted on Zoom so you will need to have a strong internet connection and working camera and microphone. </p>

                                <p dir="ltr">For students living in the USA, I accept direct transfer through Zelle or ACH transfers. I  can also accept direct payment in GBP, EUR, AUD, NZD, SGD, PLN, HUF, and TRY. For payment in any of these currencies, I will tell the student the current amount owed for their lessons according to Transferwise prior to the date their payment is due. For example, if the student owes $150 on the 1st of March and is paying in TRY, on 27th February I will calculate the amount of TRY needed to exchange for $150 and message the student with this amount to send. For students living in the following countries I can accept direct transfers from your currency to USD if you hold an account with TransferWise: Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Croatia, Japan, Malaysia, Norway, Romania, and Sweden. If the student has a Transferwise account these transfers are instant. If the student doesn’t hold an account with Transferwise, they can make a transfer using Transferwise and their credit card for next day payment. For students outside of these countries, I accept PayPal with an additional 7.5% to compensate for PayPal’s commission. </p>

My schedule changes every day so it’s not possible to guarantee a specific date and time in advance. The only way to book is to get in touch so we can discuss your needs! All queries are answered within 24 hours.</p>

This free lesson will consist of 30 minutes and I will carry out an assessment of your level of English and a brief conversation lesson. I also offer referral bonuses. If you refer a student who books a package of 5, you will get a free lesson. If you refer a student who books 2 consecutive packages of 5, you will receive 3 free lessons. If you refer a student who books 3 consecutive packages of 5, you will receive 5 free lessons.</p>

                                <p dir="ltr"><h1><strong>If I want to prepare for IELTS/TOEFL/Cambridge English, can you tell me how long I will need to study for?</strong></h1></p>

                                <p dir="ltr">This can only be assessed after your first few lessons with me. In general a minimum of 3 months is required to see a significant improvement in one area, such as listening or speaking etc. It is recommended that you allow up to 12 months to adequately prepare for such exams.</p>

                                <p dir="ltr"><h1><strong>How would you describe your teaching style?</strong></h1></p>
                                <p dir="ltr">My methodology is an adaptive one, which means that I use a different approach for each student because each of you learns differently and learning a language is never a “one size fits all” process. I have created my structured packages to cater for a wide variety of learning goals and student personal preferences. What makes me unique and different from a lot of other tutors is that I make every class fun, funny and memorable. I also focus on the student’s strengths to build your confidence, while having fun learning from your mistakes. My philosophy is that mistakes are the best way to help you learn. Most of all, I like to laugh while we’re learning. So come along and have a blast with me while building up your fluency in English.</p>
