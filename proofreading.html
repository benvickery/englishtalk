                    <h1><strong>PROOFREADING SERVICES</strong></h1>
                    
                    <p>In addition to my ESL services, I am also available for one-off tasks proofreading, creating or editing any written piece you might need assistance with. I have been working as a content editor for Fluentize since June 2019, in addition to regularly assisting my private students with a variety of proofreading and content construction tasks. I am a natural proofreader; I spot errors everywhere and automatically correct them in my head. I have done so since adolescence having been raised by an English teacher mother. I have been proofing all manner of texts for friends and family on a casual basis for years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here are some reviews written by my students regarding my abilities as a proofreader and editor:</p>

                    <br>    
            <div class="quote"><em>“Maria was able to successfully help me edit and correct a very sensitive legal act from Italian to English with amazing results despite deadline pressure since, as a non-native, I couldn’t know how to make this document perfect in professional style. On a personal level, she's very meticulous, well-spoken and always ready to lend a helping hand to her students, qualities that are sure to serve her well as an ESL editor.” </em></div>
            <div class="author"><strong>Alessia di Padova,  Strategy & Business Developer Manager</strong></div>
                <br>    
            <div class="quote"><em>“Maria told me, she will start as an ESL Editor and I think she the perfect Person for this job. I can highly recommend her because, she is very intuitive Person. She is open minded, so she understands what her students want to say. Maria knows how to figure out what I want to say, and she helps me to say it the right way.”</em></div>
            <div class="author"><strong>Gregor Danzer, sales manager for a US medical device company</strong></div>
                <br>    
            <div class="quote"><em>“When we are talking about translation from one language to another there are always exists a chance of making mistakes. Also, I’m sure, that even native speakers can make mistakes from time to time. I think, that Maria one of the professionals who can fix these mistakes very effective.  Maria is very attentive to the details and at the same time quite accurately can catch to the main idea that person would like to say or to write.  As sum up I can say that Maria really do a high-quality, professional job when editing any written piece or speech from a non-native into something that reads or sounds easily.”</em></div>
            <div class="author"><strong>Schlumberger Vostok, Senior geophysicist</strong></div>
                <br>    
                <p>In addition, this is what my manager from Fluentize had to say about my skills at proofreading:</p>  
                
            <div class="quote"><em>“Maria's most valuable skillset to the Fluentize team is her ability to thoroughly proofread and pick up every mistake that is made throughout the creation of the lesson materials that are published on the site, as well as changing wording and structure to improve flow and syntax.  Maria possesses the ability to express ideas in a clear and grammatically correct way. I am impressed by how her work has helped improve the service that we offer at Fluentize. Maria's command of English grammar, word choice, and vocabulary is superb. She puts my writing  into a more articulate format and makes it sound smooth, natural, and more concise.”</em></div>
            <div class="author"><strong>Jake Young,  Founder and Content Developer, Fluentize.com</strong></div>
                <br> 
              
            <p>I am available for any proofreading or content creation task, from anything such as a short business email up to a written essay or report up to a maximum of approximately 10,000 words (this can be negotiated). My minimum charge is $35 for anything up to 500 words. Any length above this count will be charged at a rate of $50 per hour worked. The number of hours I will require to complete the proofreading will depend on the level of English of the writer, along with degree of difficulty in determining meaning and context, frequency of errors and other deciding factors. I can provide an approximate total cost after reviewing your document prior to commencement of work. Feel free to contact me with your proofreading or content creation request.</p>
